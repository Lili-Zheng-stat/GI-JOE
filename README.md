# GI-JOE: Graph Inference when Joint Observations are Erose
This repository contains the R code for running GI-JOE method and reproducing the empirical results in the paper ``Graphical Model Inference with Erosely
Measured Data".

## Main Functions
The folder *Methods* contains the R code for running the GI-JOE method and running some baseline methods (neighborhood lasso, graphical lasso, CLIME, debiased graphical lasso) under the erose measurement settings.

## Simulations
The folder *Simulations* contains the R code for running and summarizing the simulations included in the paper. The functions used for simulation set-ups are included in the *DataGeneration* folder. All results can be found in the *Results* folder.

## Real Data Experiments
The main code for real data experiments are included in *NeuroscienceDataAnalysis*.
